Description: Implements the necessary distributions and parameter estimation
    procedures for a model of amplification and high-troughput sequencing. The
    model is based on a mechanistic model of PCR amplification as a Galton-Watson
    branching process, and on Poissonan sampling to model high-throughput
    sequencing.
